Enjoy our family recipe book "...And Now I Dream of Tuna Fish"

These are "comfort food" recipes from our family to yours!  

CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION! Many of these recipes contain typos or subtle errors!  Read each with a "grain of salt" (ahem).  Beyond the inconsequential typos (e.g. "Lamp" instead of "Lamb"), we have occasionally found teaspoon and tablespoon amounts swapped, or "1/2 cup" where "12 cups" was intended. Consider this an Easter Egg hunt!  

When you find such errors, please feel free to correct them.  Or add your own favorite recipes!

This recipe book was created with LibreOffice (version 6.2.8.2 and above).  it uses LO subdocuments and styles to format the recipe components -- e.g. receipe pages, titles, ingredients, instructions, section pages, etc.  These also support the ability to maintain an index at the end of the recipe book.  Individual pages intentionally do not include page numbers so that you can add new pages to an existing printed version of the book without creating confusing non-sequential page numbers and similar headaches. In a hardcopy version the index will still be useful to lead you to the general area of your interest.

To build the complete recipe book, open the master document (AndNowIDreamRecipeBookMaster.odm), answer YES to any prompt to update links, AND THEN select <View...Navigator> and select <Update...All> from within the Navigator to rebuild the entire master document.  If you omit this last step then you are likely to get a new master document with an outdated index, or blank index pages.

To create a PDF version choose <File...Export As...Export Directly as PDF>.  This will create a searchable PDF document, whereas printing to a PDF document from the print menu may create a graphic-image PDF -- which is not searchable.

The page format assumes a 1/2-letter size -- i.e. a normal 8.5x11 sheet cut in half to form two sheets 5.5 wide by 8.5 inches tall.  If you print this double-sided on heavy weight paper stock and hole punch the pages, they will fit very nicely into a small 3-ring binder that when open lies flat and doesn't take up much space on your countertop.
