To add new recipes or make corrections:

1) Use LibreOffice to open the master doc (.odm)
2) Open the Navigator view to see all the subdocuments;
3) To make a change you MUST edit the subdocument; changes to the master do not persist!
4) You can use the navigator to select a subdoc by double-clicking on it.
5) To add a new recipe, copy an existing recipe page, paste in the copy, and then edit it. This is the easiest way to maintain formatting.
6) After you have modified the subdoc, propagate the change to the master by selecting "Update->All" in the top menu bar of the Navigator;
7) Save the master doc (.odm) so that it too has the latest subdoc changes.
8) Export the master doc to a pdf so that you have a static copy of the new recipe book.

Note that styles in the master doc override styles in subdocs with the same name. So to prevent formatting surprises, if you change a style, make sure that new version exists in both the master and the subdoc.
